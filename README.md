# Automating Bank Cheque Extraction from Scanned Documents

This project, Automating Bank Cheque Extraction from Scanned Documentss, aims to develop an automated pipeline that extracts and processes cheque details from scanned PDF documents. It uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technologies to recognize key information from cheque images, such as:


- Bank name
- Cheque number
- Account holderâ€™s name
- IFSC code
- MICR code
- Amount
- Date of issuance



## Features

- Automated Cheque Extraction: Extracts essential information from scanned cheque PDFs.
- Batch Processing: Supports processing multiple PDF files at once.
- Data Export: Saves extracted data in CSV or Excel format for easy analysis.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Provides a simple interface to run the application.
- Logging & Error Handling: Logs the process and captures any errors for review.
## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Tesseract OCR
- Libraries from requirements.txt

Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automating-Bank-Cheque-Extraction.git
 cd Automating-Bank-Cheque-Extraction

```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```   
3. [Install Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract):


4. Add Tesseract to your system PATH.
## Usage/Examples
### Running the Extraction Script
1. Place the scanned PDF files in the data/ folder.

2. Run the main script:
```python
python src/main.py --input data/cheque.pdf --output output/extracted_data.csv

```

3. You can also use the GUI:
```python
python src/gui.py
```

### Output
The extracted cheque information will be stored in output/extracted_data.csv and output/extracted_text.xlsx.
## Technology Stack


**Python:** Core language for development.
